          <p>Hello, my name is Nathan Ley and I am a 17 year old 
          web developer and designer based out of Paynesville,
          MN. Throughout my life, I struggled with consistency
          and work. At the age of 16, I decided I was sick of that
          and got into an  area that seemed very interesting for 
          me: web development. When I found web 
          development, my consitency and work ethic changed 
          dramatically. Over the last year, I have learned some of
          the latest languages and tools in the industry, becoming 
          expereinced in each. My drive to work and provide
          consistent value to my clients are now steadfast, 
          creating a happy relationship.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In my freetime, I like to learn new programming languages, play some 
          video games, design and develop websites, and network with people in the 
          tech industry.</p>
