          <h2> Who am I?</h2>
          <p>Hello, my name is Nathan Ley and I am a 17 year old 
          web developer and designer based out of Paynesville,
          MN . . . In the middle of nowhere ;)</p>
          <br><br>

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>At the age of 16, I wanted to get into an area 
          that really encaptured all of my God given gifts. I 
          needed something with some structure, creativity,
          and most importantly, helping people. An area 
          that seemed to fit for me was web development. 
          When I found web development, my consistency 
          and work ethic changed dramatically. My drive to 
          work and provide superior value to my clients
          is now steadfast, creating a happy relationships. I 
          take pride in providing the latest languages and 
          tools in the industry, being expereinced in each.</p>
          <br><br>

          <h2>When I am not working</h2>
          <p>In my freetime, I like to learn new programming languages, play some 
          video games, do calisthenics, and network with other people in the 
          tech industry.</p>
