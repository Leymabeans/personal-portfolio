        <h2> Who am I?</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Nathan Ley and I am a 17 year old 
        professional web developer and designer based out of Paynesville,
        MN. </p>
        
        <p>A small group of languages that I focus on are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and Python. Aside from programming, I offer services such as SEO and WordPress work, as well as database management.</p>
          
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>At the age of 16, I wanted to get into an area 
        that really encaptured all of my God given gifts. I 
        needed something with structure, creativity,
        and most importantly, helping people. An area 
        that did that for me was web development, and many clients later, I am growing my freelance web development business </p>
        
        <h2>My Specialty</h2>
        <p>I am dedicated to providing quality, “elastic” development. Elastic development is a solution I provide where I grow alongside you and your team. In other words, no matter the scale of the project, I can adjust and accommodate to your needs. I take pride in communication and my development process as it is intuitive and client friendly.</p>
