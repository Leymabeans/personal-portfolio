        <h2> Who am I?</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Nathan Ley and I am a 17 year old 
        professional web developer and designer based out of Paynesville,
        MN.</p>
          
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>At the age of 16, I wanted to get into an area 
        that really encaptured all of my God given gifts. I 
        needed something with some structure, creativity,
        and most importantly, helping people. An area 
        that did that for me was web development. </p>

        <p>
        When I found web development, my consistency 
        and work ethic changed dramatically. My drive to 
        work and provide superior value to my clients
        is now steadfast, creating a happy relationships. I 
        take pride in providing the latest languages and 
        tools in the industry, being expereinced in each.</p>

        <h2>In my freetime...</h2>
        <p>In my freetime, I like to learn new programming languages, play some 
        video games, lift weight, and network with other people in the 
        tech industry.</p>
