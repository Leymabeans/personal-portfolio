## Content
This repostitory contains the personal site of me, Nathan Ley, a frontend web devloper based in Belgrade, Minnesota. Details include services I provide, partners I work with, my project portfolio, and other recommendations. Each featured client project has their own page where you can learn about their business mission, my deliverables, and how I was able to provide for them. Included are links to all of my social media, where I post my story as a 18 year old web developer. I also include my UpWork profile, where you can chat and hire me for a project.<br><br>

## Development
I <b>(NathanLeysGit)</b> created the designs as well as the front end of the site. I utilized HTML, SASS, JS, Parcel, NPM, Adobe XD and other tools and languages to make this website come alive.
