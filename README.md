## Content
This repostitory contains the personal site of me, Nathan Ley, a fullstack LAMP web devloper based in Minnesota. Details include services I provide, partners I work with, my project portfolio, and other recommendations. Each past client project has their own project page where you can learn about what they are, my deliverables, and how the site design looks. Also included are links to all of my social media, where I post my story as a 17 year old web developer.<br><br>

## Development
I <b>(NathanLeysGit)</b> created the designs as well as the front end of the site. Due to it being a simple portfolio page, there were no backend languages used in the development.
