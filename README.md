## Content
This repostitory contains the personal site of me, Nathan Ley, a fullstack web devloper based in Minnesota. Details include sections about me, tools I use, and feedback from past clients. Also included are links to all of my social media, where I post my story as a 17 year old web developer.<br><br>

## Development
Nathan Ley <b>(NathanLeysGit)</b> created the designs as well as the front end of the site. Due to it being a simple portfolio page, there were no backend languages used in the development.
