# NathanLey
This repository holds the personal site of me, Nathan Ley. I am a 17 year old designer and developer <br>
based in MN, where I do freelancing with clients. Within my site, I broadcast my step process, tools I <br>
use, and feedback from past clients.<br><br>

Oh, and one other thing: Giddy is very kind. He will guide you around the site so you mustn't be <br>
mean to him. Enjoy<br>
