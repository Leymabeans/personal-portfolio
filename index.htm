        <p class="description">Working with Nathan was a clean, and efficient experience. Being a bit on the younger side, he brought a lot of new, modern designs to the table. I could always rely on him to meet deadlines, and would truly recommend him to anyone out there looking for a developer. Without him, our business would not be the same. </p>

        <p class="description">Nathan was awesome to work with. He went above and beyond what was required of him for the project. He is highly experienced in what he does and I would recommend him to anyone. My favorite part is he is self-managed, has great communication and delivers quality work at the end of the day. Someone like him is extremely hard to find on this platform. Highly recommended. </p>
