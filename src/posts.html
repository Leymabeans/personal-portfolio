            <h1 class="card-title">New Years Resolutions</h1>
            <p>What are my New Year’s resolutions?</p>
            <p>I have none.</p>
            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>New Year’s resolutions are thought to be a new beginning to a new you. While they work for a few, many of the times, research shows people give up on New Year’s resolutions within the first two weeks.</p>
            <p>They are usually something that are overhyped and set up to fail. Many want to change but are not in the position, nor mindset to do so.</p>
            <p>Set resolutions during the week. During the month. Set them when you are ready to change something, not just because society says you should. </p>

            <h1 class="card-title">Motivation or Inspiration?</h1>
            <p>I had always used the terms interchangeably, but after some thinking I realized there is a significant difference between the two.</p>
            <p>When I think of motivation, I think of a mood that you are in. You felt good today and felt motivated to do something. </p>
            <p>Thinking of inspiration, it's more of a mindset you are in. You saw someone do something great and you want to be like them.</p>
            <p>To me, it's clear that inspiration is the bigger kicker here. Mindset is much more powerful (and important) component than a mood. Inspiration can allow you to stay consistently working at something, because there is an end goal you have in mind.</p>
            <p>Moral of the story here? Find some inspiration and get to work.</p>
